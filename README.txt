A Website for the Science Hack Day event to be held in Nairobi on the 14th and 15th of April 2012.  
It is written in Python [ www.python.org ] and django [ www.djangoproject.com ]. It has two dependencies: 

1) python markdown 
2) django tagging 

To get these components as painlessly as possible, first:
=> Install the language itself from [ http://www.python.org/getit/ ]. Versions from 2.6 onwards but 
not including 3.0 are recommended,

=> Obtain Python's Setup tools package from [ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files ]. Then setup 
the dependencies by running the commands from your computer terminal: 

$ easy_install django 
$ easy_install markdown 
$ easy_install django-tagging 

The site should be able to run after this without any problems.
