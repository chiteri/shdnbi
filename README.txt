A Website for the Science Hack Day event to be held in Nairobi on the 14th and 15th of April 2012. 
The system is written in django and has three dependencies: 

1) python markdown 
2) django tagging 
3) event brite client in python.

To get these components as painlessly as possible, install Python's easy install from here [ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files ]. 
The install the dependencies by running the commands: 

easy_install django 
easy_install markdown 
easy_install django-tagging 
easy_install eventbrite 

The site should be able to run after this without any problems
